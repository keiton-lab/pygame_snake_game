    ** the background music was not recorded in the video. 

### This is my second personal project.
### The objective of this project is for me to learn pygame and improve my programing skill. 

To make the original game more enjoyable and compeleted, I developed the following features/method in the code:
  1. Added background music during the entire game
  2. A "PAUSED" feature to stop the game, and resume or quit if needed
  3. A method that keep track of the highest score in game (lower righthand corner)

This snake game is inspired by and developed based on https://github.com/clear-code-projects/Snake
